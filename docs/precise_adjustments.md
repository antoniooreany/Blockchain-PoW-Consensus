To adjust the difficulty more scientifically, you can use a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This approach allows for more precise control over the difficulty adjustments based on the time taken to mine blocks.

### PID Controller for Difficulty Adjustment

1. **Proportional (P)**: Adjusts the difficulty based on the current error (difference between actual and expected time).
2. **Integral (I)**: Adjusts based on the accumulation of past errors.
3. **Derivative (D)**: Adjusts based on the rate of change of the error.

### Implementation

First, let's define a `PIDController` class:

```python
```python
class PIDController:
    def __init__(self, kp: float, ki: float, kd: float) -> None:
        self.kp = kp
        self.ki = ki
        self.kd = kd
        self.integral = 0.0
        self.previous_error = 0.0

    def update(self, error: float, delta_time: float) -> float:
        self.integral += error * delta_time
        derivative = (error - self.previous_error) / delta_time
        self.previous_error = error
        return self.kp * error + self.ki * self.integral + self.kd * derivative
```

Next, integrate the `PIDController` into the `Blockchain` class:

```python
class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self, initial_difficulty: int, target_block_time: float, base: int = 2) -> None:
        self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]
        self.difficulty = initial_difficulty
        self.target_block_time = target_block_time  # Target block time in seconds
        self.base = base  # Base for numeral system
        self.pid_controller = PIDController(kp=1.0, ki=0.1, kd=0.05)  # Initialize PID controller with chosen coefficients

    def create_genesis_block(self) -> Block:
        genesis_block = Block(0, time.time(), "Genesis Block", "0")
        log_mined_block(genesis_block)
        actual_time = 0  # Genesis block has no previous block, so actual time is 0
        expected_time = 1  # Set the expected time for the genesis block
        log_time(actual_time, expected_time)
        return genesis_block

    def add_block(self, new_block: Block, difficulty_coefficient: float) -> None:
        new_block.previous_hash = self.get_latest_block().hash  # Set the previous hash of the new block to the hash of the latest block
        new_block.mine(self.difficulty, self.base)  # Pass the chosen numeral system
        self.chain.append(new_block)
        self.adjust_difficulty(difficulty_coefficient)
        log_validity(self)
        logger.debug(f"Difficulty: {self.difficulty}")

    def adjust_difficulty(self, difficulty_coefficient: float) -> None:
        if len(self.chain) < 2:
            return  # No adjustment needed for genesis block
        last_block: Block = self.chain[-1]
        prev_block: Block = self.chain[-2]
        actual_time: float = last_block.timestamp - prev_block.timestamp
        expected_time: float = self.target_block_time  # Expected time in seconds
        log_time(actual_time, expected_time)
        error = expected_time - actual_time
        adjustment = self.pid_controller.update(error, actual_time)
        self.difficulty += int(adjustment)
        if self.difficulty < 1:
            self.difficulty = 1  # Ensure difficulty does not drop below 1

    def is_chain_valid(self) -> bool:
        for i in range(1, len(self.chain)):
            current_block: Block = self.chain[i]
            previous_block: Block = self.chain[i - 1]
            if current_block.hash != current_block.calculate_hash():
                return False
            if current_block.previous_hash != previous_block.hash:
                return False
        return True

    def get_latest_block(self) -> Block:
        return self.chain[-1]
```

### Main Execution

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    logger: logging.Logger = setup_logger()

    blockchain: Blockchain = Blockchain(
        initial_difficulty=3,  # Set the initial difficulty
        target_block_time=1,  # Set the target block time in seconds
        base=2  # Use binary system by default
    )

    log_validity(blockchain)
    logger.debug(f"Difficulty: {blockchain.difficulty}")

    mine_blocks(blockchain, num_blocks=10, difficulty_coefficient=1.5)
```

This implementation uses a PID controller to adjust the difficulty more scientifically, providing smoother and more precise adjustments based on the mining time.



## Conclusion

Using a PID controller for difficulty adjustment in blockchain mining offers several benefits:

1. **Precision**: PID controllers provide precise control over the difficulty adjustments by considering the current error, the accumulation of past errors, and the rate of change of the error.

2. **Stability**: By using the integral and derivative components, PID controllers help stabilize the difficulty adjustments, preventing abrupt changes that could destabilize the mining process.

3. **Responsiveness**: The proportional component allows the system to respond quickly to changes in the mining time, ensuring that the difficulty is adjusted in a timely manner.

4. **Smooth Adjustments**: The combination of proportional, integral, and derivative adjustments results in smoother difficulty changes, avoiding large jumps that could occur with simpler adjustment methods.

5. **Adaptability**: PID controllers can be tuned to adapt to different mining conditions and target block times, making them versatile for various blockchain implementations.
