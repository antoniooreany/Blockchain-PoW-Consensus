The error message indicates that there is an issue with the path or syntax used to run the Python interpreter. This could be due to an incorrect path or missing directory information.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the path to the Python interpreter is correct and that the working directory is properly set. Here are the steps to check and fix this in PyCharm:

1. **Check the Python Interpreter Path**:
   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `Ctrl+Alt+S`).
   - Navigate to `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.
   - Ensure that the path to the Python interpreter is correct. It should point to `C:\Users\anton\PycharmProjects\Blockchain-PoW-Consensus\venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

2. **Set the Working Directory**:
   - Go to `Run` > `Edit Configurations`.
   - Select your run configuration.
   - Ensure that the `Working directory` field is set to the root directory of your project, e.g., `C:\Users\anton\PycharmProjects\Blockchain-PoW-Consensus`.

3. **Check for Special Characters**:
   - Ensure that there are no special characters or spaces in the path that might cause issues.

After verifying and correcting these settings, try running your program again.
