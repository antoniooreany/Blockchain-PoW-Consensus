# Assume data is preprocessed and ready in variables: `block_index`, `mining_time`, `difficulty`


# Example usage:
# plot_gpt_suggestion(block_index=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], mining_time=[0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9], difficulty=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# block_index =
# mining_time =
# bit_difficulty =
# plot_gpt_suggestion(block_index=block_index, mining_time=mining_time, bit_difficulty=bit_difficulty)
